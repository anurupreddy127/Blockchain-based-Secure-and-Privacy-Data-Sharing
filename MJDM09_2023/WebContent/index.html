				<p style="text-align: justify;">Blockchain is a progressive innovation technology that permits individuals to record message exchanges or transactions on an advanced, decentralized, distributed ledger, with no central controlling authority as in
case of financial banking systems. Recorded transactions are
seen to all users within the blockchain network and cannot
be modified by any user or node. Blockchain has become
popular with many other applications including IoT,
healthcare, industry, supply chain management etc.
Blockchain technology is ready to change almost every
aspect of our advanced digital lives. By obviating third
parties, blockchains guarantee to make our frameworks
more effective. By going around oversight, they guarantee to
make our frameworks more impartial. Also, if appropriately
executed, they could make our frameworks more dependable
and secure. The purpose of this review is to understand
blockchain technology and challenges associated with its
security and privacytransactions without trusted third parties, and the transactions on the blockchain are trackable and irreversible. Therefore, both the buyer and the seller cannot breach the contract. All processes are recorded on the blockchain including the product launch, purchase, delivery, and payment. It is trackable and could be submitted to courts as electronic evidence to solve the transaction disputes.</p>
